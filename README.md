For this consolation project I have decided to go along and try to make the card memory game. This game is a simple card memory game in Python. It involves one or more players who take turns revealing cards from a shuffled deck. Players accumulate points based on the cards they reveal and the game continues until a player reaches a certain number of points or after a specified number of turns. Some features that are included in this game are a player class which represents each player in the game and each player has a name and points that are kept track of. Another feature is the card memory game class which manages the game flow and logic. Some of the other features are the deck generation, shuffling and dealing, turn based and win condition. The first step is the run the sciprt as it will print prompts that the user will have to input the information of the number of players and the names of whos playing. Following this each player will be dealt five card from the deck. Finally, the game ends when a player reaches 25 points or has taken 3 turns. My code runs the game smoothly but I have ran into an issue where the game ends after 3 turns and there is never a winner so this is the only thing that my game cannot output right now.
